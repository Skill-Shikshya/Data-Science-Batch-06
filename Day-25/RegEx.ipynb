    "# Regular Expression in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions (also known as regex or regexp) are a powerful tool for searching and manipulating text. They allow you to define a pattern or set of rules that describe a particular string of characters, and then search for or manipulate any text that matches that pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions are commonly used in programming, particularly for tasks like data validation, searching and replacing text, and parsing strings. They are also useful in text editors, command-line tools, and other applications that involve working with text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the benefits of using regular expressions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flexibility:** Regular expressions are incredibly flexible and can match a wide range of patterns, from simple strings to complex sequences of characters.\n",
    "- **Efficiency:** Regular expressions are often faster than alternative methods for text processing, particularly for large amounts of data.\n",
    "- **Accuracy:** Regular expressions are very precise and can be used to match specific patterns, ensuring that you only work with the data that you need.\n",
    "- **Standardization:** Regular expressions are a widely accepted standard for working with text, making it easier to share and collaborate on code that involves text processing.\n",

    "## Python RegEx Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides a powerful module called `re` for working with regular expressions. This module provides various methods for working with regular expressions in Python, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. re.search(pattern, string, flags=0) \n",
    "\n",
    "The `re.search()` function is used to search for a pattern in a string and return the first occurrence of the pattern. It returns `None` if the match is not found. This is equivalent to `in` operator used with python string. Since the result is either some value or None, depending on whether a match was found or not, the result can be used with conditional expressions as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `pattern`: The regular expression pattern to search for\n",
    "- `string`: The string to search in\n",
    "- `flags (optional)`: A set of flags that modify the behavior of the search\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a good idea to use raw strings (represented as `r'...'`) to define regular expression patterns. This will make more sense later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The match object contains information about the match. Some of the useful methods and attributes of the match object are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `group()`: Returns the matched string\n",
    "- `start()`: Returns the starting index of the match\n",
    "- `end()`: Returns the ending index of the match\n",

    "## Python RegEx Flags\n",
    "\n",
    "Flags in Python's `re` module are optional arguments that modify the behavior of regular expression functions. These flags allow you to control how regular expressions are matched and interpreted. Here are some of the most commonly used flags:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `re.IGNORECASE`: Ignores case when matching characters. For example, the pattern r'cat' would match the string \"cat\", \"Cat\", and \"CAT\" with this flag.\n",
    "- `re.MULTILINE`: Allows the pattern to match multiple lines in a string. This flag changes the meaning of the `^` and `$` metacharacters to match the beginning and end of each line, rather than just the beginning and end of the entire string.\n",
    "- `re.DOTALL`: Allows the dot (`.`) metacharacter to match any character, including newline characters.\n",
    "- `re.VERBOSE`: Allows you to add comments and whitespace to your regular expression pattern, making it easier to read and understand.\n",
    "- `re.ASCII`: Makes `\\w`, `\\W`, `\\b`, `\\B`, `\\d`, `\\D`, `\\s` and `\\S` perform ASCII-only matching instead of Unicode matching.\n",
    "- `re.UNICODE`: Makes `\\w`, `\\W`, `\\b`, `\\B`, `\\d` and `\\D` perform Unicode matching instead of ASCII-only matching.\n",
    "- `re.LOCALE`: Makes `\\w`, `\\W`, `\\b`, `\\B`, `\\d` and `\\D` perform matching according to the current locale.\n",
    "- `re.DEBUG`: Enable debug output for the regular expression engine.\n",
    "- `re.A`: This is an alias for `re.ASCII`.\n",
    "- `re.I`: This is an alias for `re.IGNORECASE`.\n",
    "- `re.M`: This is an alias for `re.MULTILINE`.\n",
    "- `re.S`: This is an alias for `re.DOTALL`.\n",
    "- `re.X`: This is an alias for `re.VERBOSE`.\n",
    "- `re.U`: This is an alias for `re.UNICODE`.\n",
    "- `re.L`: This is an alias for `re.LOCALE`."
